## Quotes and Notes from the book

### <p>"The fact is, motivation and cooperation deteriorate when there is a lack of purpose.  You can train leaders on communication and team-work and conduct 360 feedback reports until you are blue in the face, but if a team does not have clarity of goals and roles, problems will fester and multiply.</p>
### <p>This is not just my theory or something I read in another business book.  In gathering data from more than five hundred people about their experience on more than one thousand teams, I have found a consistent reality:  When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration.  When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive." </p>Page 121
